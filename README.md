to experiments with neural model do the folowwing

1. run dataPreprocessing.py and set the path to the tain.csv   ## the the file vocab.txt is already been there for the whole so not need to run it again untill you change your data

2. run the project.py initially for partial data  and then for full data by changing file path

to perform experiments with bernoliNB do the folowwling.

1. run either of the file inside the Bayes Folder
  NBayes_usingSciketLearn.py    or  BernoliNaiveBayes.py    the later one is a super slower implementation and require lots of memorry
  
 have  fun!
